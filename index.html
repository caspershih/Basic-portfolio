        My name is Casper Shih. I graduated from Califronia State University, Fullerton with a Biology degree.
        I joined the UCI Bootcamp to learn another profession skill set in order to seek for other career opportunities.
        Also I have more than thousand hours of experience working at physical therapy clinics.
        Upon finishing this coding bootcamp, I would love to apply my experience in both physical therapy and web development.
