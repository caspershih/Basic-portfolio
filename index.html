    <p>
        I graduated from California State University, Fullerton with the degree of Biology. 
        While in school, I was also working as a volunteering and physical therapy aide for two years. 
        Furthermore, I also worked as an assistant coach on the cross country team at Arcadia High School for seven years. 
        From both previous experience, I acquired the skill of communicating with people effectively, and I can work with various size of groups comfortablely. 
        Currently, I am taking a course at University of California, Irvine to learn the skill of web development. 
        It is actually a skill set I enjoy learning. Upon finishing this program, I will be actively looking for back end developer position.
